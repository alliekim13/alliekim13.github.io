As an electrical engineering research assistant in the Environmental Research and Design Lab at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, I provided the support for a study to measure the effects of using chilled water passed through cooling panels on a person's comfort. I was responsible for setting up the sensors to measure water flow rate and temperature as it was passed through cooling panels and anemometors to measure air flow throughout the test environment. I also helped maintain an automated system that uploaded the data collected from these sensors to a remote database using Python and SQL scripts. I was also exposed to Tableau which allowed us to visualize the data collected.
