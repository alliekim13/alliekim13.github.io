summary: Project using over a dozen sensors to monitor the cooling effects of placing chilled panels in a cubicle. 
---

As an electrical engineering research assistant in the Environmental Research and Design Lab, I provided the support for a study to measure the effects of using chilled water passed through cooling panels on a person's comfort. I was responsible for setting up the sensors to measure water flow rate and temperature as chilled water was passed through cooling panels. I was also responsible for wiring anemometors to our data collection device to measure air flow throughout the test environment. I helped maintain an automated system that uploaded the data collected from these sensors to a remote database using Python and SQL scripts listed below. I took the scripts written by a former member of the lab and configured them for this system. I was also exposed to Tableau which was used to visualize the data collected. From this project, I furthered my understanding of Python, was exposed to SQL and learned about basic sensor setup.
