# Project Overview
I worked on a team of University of Hawaii computer science and computer engineering students under the guidance of Professor Philip Johnson to build a web application, Alloy. Here's a link to our team's project page. The application was built using the web application framework, Meteor.

It is often difficult for students interested in working on projects to find a team of people with the right set of skills. The idea behind Alloy was to create an application that helps UH students find teams. It allows students who either have a project idea or want to work on a side project to connect with potential team members based on skills necessary to complete the project. 

Some of the use cases include:
* Creating profiles that list skills
* Creating projects that other people can browse and join
* Suggesting relevant projects based ona  user's skills
* Searching for people and projects based on skills

Below is a screen caputre of the project home page which has a list of featured projects.

### Meteor Application Development
I was primarily responsible for designing the layout of pages. In order to create these pages, the team used HTML, Semantic UI, JavaScript and some CSS. In order to improve the efficiency with which we could test and merge incremental changes, our team used Git and GitHub for version control. I designed the layout for the landing page, user home page, user profile page, project profile page and the pages to edit profile information. On these pages, I also implemented the functionality to collect data from the input fields and write them to the database.
