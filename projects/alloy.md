# Project Overview
I worked on a team of University of Hawaii computer science and computer engineering students under the guidance of Professor Philip Johnson to build a web application, Alloy. See more about The application was built using the web application framework, Meteor.

It is often difficult for students interested in working on projects to find a team of people with the right set of skills. The idea behind Alloy was to create an application that helps UH students find teams. It allows students who either have a project idea or want to work on a side project to connect with potential team members based on a user's skills and a set of skills necessary to complete the project. 

Some of the use cases include:
* Creating profiles that list skills
* Creating projects that other people can browse and join
* Suggesting relevant projects based ona  user's skills
* Searching for people and projects based on skills

Below is a screen caputre of the project home page which has a list of featured projects.

I was primarily responsible for designing the layout of pages. I designed the layout for the landing page, user home page, user profile page, project profile page and the pages to edit profile information.
