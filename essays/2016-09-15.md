## Git and GitHub
Configuration management is a way of managing changes to software, which is critical in creating large software systems. Git is a configuration management tool that focuses on source control management. GitHub is a hosting platform for Git repositories. Users can sign up for an account and can view others' code, contribute to a certain project with other users, and even host small websites like this site you're looking at right now. I think Git's popularity is due to the popularity of GitHub. Especially in the world of software engineering, where a lot of work is done in teams, it is extremely cruicial that team members have a unified development and version control style. With the invention of GitHub, Git, which is used for local source control, could be used to share code with others and even collaborate on large projects in parallel. 

## My Experiences with Configuration Management
I have used Git and GitHub to manage my own files but have not used it to manage changes on large software projects with multiple contributors. When I heard of these tools, I didn't rush to use them. I resorted to creating local copies of my project and denoted versions by using names such as "filename-1, filename-2" and so forth. The comic below illustrates my former method of version control.

However, I eventually turned to using Git and GitHub and am very glad that I did. It is much cleaner than creating new versions of a file and is much better for pushing incremental changes as opposed to a day's worth of code. Also, thanks to GitHub, I can access my code from any computer without having to email files to myself.
