Software engineering is an intriguing field because it is ever-evolving and increasingly relevant in our everyday lives. The technologies we use to improve our lives are developed in part by software engineers. It is hard to imagine many things we have today that a software engineer hasn't played a role in making. Studying software engineering has opened my eyes to the world around me and has made me a much more curious person. As a child amd evem throughout high school, I took for granted a lot of the technologies around me. However, studying software engineering in college gave me the fundamentals to understand bits and pieces of the technology around me that I previously had no relation to. 

I see software engineering as an opportunity to make a positive impact in my community and in the world. I have the tools to educate others about technology and the background to build technology for good causes. I also have a lot of ideas and feel like having the software engineering toolkit gives me the opportunity to bring many ideas to life. 

I hope to expand my knowledge in the area of embedded software and web applications. I feel like this growing area of software engineering has so many possibilities to positively impact our lives. I hope to someday work on a program, service or device that I use in my everyday life. 

I also believe software engineering has the opportunity to change communities - not only by the products created but the culture of knowledge, innovation and collaboration it promotes amongst those working in the industry. I hope, someday, to use my position in industry to act as a mentor and resource for students looking into software or computer engineering.
