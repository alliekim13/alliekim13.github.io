Software engineering is an intriguing field because it is ever-evolving and relevant in our everyday lives. The technologies we use to improve our lives are developed in part by software engineers. I like that software engineering has given me a glimpse into how certain technologies work; And not only how they work, but how they can be improved. 

I hope to expand my knowledge in the area of big data and machine learning because I feel like this growing area of software engineering has so many possibilities to positively impact our lives. I hope to someday work on a program, service or device that I use in my everyday life. 

I also believe software engineering has the opportunity to change communities - not only by the products created but the culture of knowledge, innovation and collaboration it promotes amongst those working in the industry. I hope, someday, to use my position in industry to act as a mentor and resource for students looking into software or computer engineering.
