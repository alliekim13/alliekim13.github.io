I've had prior experience using HTML and CSS, so I've been exposed to certain pieces of Javascript through Google searches on how to develop webpages. However, this is my first time learning the basics of Javascript. I also have had experience programming in C and Python. I'm finding the syntax of Javascript to be a medium between C and Python in which it's not necessary to declare variable types as in C but it isn't as readable as Python.

From a software engineering perspective, I think a good thing about Javascript as a programming language is that it does not require that you define variable types such as strings, integers, float values and so forth for each variable. In this way, it is more user-friendly, practical and less tedious than other languages such as C or C++. However, the lack of required variable definitions may be a missed learning opportunity to people who are first exposed to programming through Javascript. Through my personal experiences, having to declare variable types in C has made me a much more meticulous and thoughtful programmer.

I feel as though athletic software engineering is beneficial because it breaks the process of learning software engineering concepts into manageable modules. Practice WODs are useful in gauging proficiency, strengths and weaknesses without the pressure of an exam. In-class WODs can often be stressful as they do count for credit, but the experience in programming under stress is practical because in industry, deadlines are common and being able to program under stress is expected. Overall, I see the stress of in-class WODs as beneficial in the long run.
