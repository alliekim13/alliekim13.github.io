I find that ESLint is a great tool for enforcing good coding practices. White spaces, though they may seem insignificant, have really helped make my code more readable. Having well-formatted code plays a huge role in readability and productivity. I typically develop using vi in the shell and do not have a formatting standard. I've had many situations where I cannot see what is encapsulated within a code block such as loops or while statements because I don't use indentations. This results in a decrease in productivity and some frustration. I can avoid all of this by using ESLint to manage my formatting. 

I initially had a bit of trouble setting up ESLint in my devleopment environment, IntelliJ IDEA. Getting the settings right took a while and a few searches on the internet, but once I was up and running with ESLint, I found that I was writing much cleaner and understandable code. I got a few errors at first while using ESLint but getting the green checkmark became increasingly easier as I developed the behavior of writing code formatted to the ESLint standard.

ESLint also allows for consistent and readable code that everyone on a project or trying to understand the code can easily track. This is very valuable especially in the software engineering world where coding standards can vary from person-to-person and multiple people develop code. 

Although ESLint takes time to configure, I think it is worth the intial time investment. It definitely pays for itself in time not wasted dealing with poorly-formatted code.
