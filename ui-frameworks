I find that semantic UI makes life much easier by allowing us to create visually appealing webpages with a limited amount of tweaking CSS and HTML to make borders look nice and create a simple menu bar. Though there is a learning curve associated with learning to use these UI frameworks, it is an investment of time that is definitely worth it in the long run when you're able to create professional, clean and nicely laid out webpages in significantly less time if you were to just rely on HTML and CSS. When you learn Semantic UI or any other UI frameworks, you are able to focus less on the low-level details such as adding borders to a menu bar or creating tables to space content out evenly and more on getting the necessary content on you webpage in a minimal amount of time.

UI Frameworks dramatically increase the speed with which web applications can be developed. They also reduce the need for a deep knowledge of HTML and CSS in order to develop professional-looking web applications. This allows software engineers to focus more on other aspects of their web applications.

I personally found using Semantic UI convenient and rewarding when I was able to create a nice web page without spending hours tweaking my HTML/CSS files. However, I haven't used any frameworks prior to this experience so I did find it a little challenging to incorporate my own CSS on top of Semantic UI. But overall, I felt like learning Semantic UI gave me a better understanding of creating user interfaces.
